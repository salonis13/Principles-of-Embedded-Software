 * Parameters:
 *   buf      Pointer to the data
 *   nbyte    Max number of bytes to enqueue
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   The number of bytes actually enqueued, which could be 0. In case

 * Attempts to remove ("dequeue") up to nbyte bytes of data from the
 * FIFO. Removed data will be copied into the buffer pointed to by buf.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   buf      Destination for the dequeued data
 *   nbyte    Bytes of data requested
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   The number of bytes actually copied, which will be between 0 and
 * nbyte. 
 * 
 * To further explain the behavior: If the FIFO's current length is 24
 * bytes, and the caller requests 30 bytes, cbfifo_dequeue should
 * return the 24 bytes it has, and the new FIFO length will be 0. If
 * the FIFO is empty (current length is 0 bytes), a request to dequeue
 * any number of bytes will result in a return of 0 from
 * cbfifo_dequeue.
